### Source Code

Okay, so what do you do first?<br>
Just fallow these simple steps!<br>
<br>
1. Find your visual basic folder<br>
2. Double click on it.<br>
3. Find the executable for the program Visual Basic 'File name may vary depending on which version you have.<br>
4. Double click on that! 'Now, I hope you arnt lost, if you are you need to find a tutorial that is a bit easier to fallow<br>
5. A box should appear asking what type of project you want to create 'A project is the term used for a new application <br>
6. Choose your type of project and click on Open... 'The most common type of project is DHTML Application<br><BR><BR><BR>
Thats it!!! You have completed one of the most demanded tutorials ever.<br><BR>
It took me so long to figure this out but I got it working! I hope you don't have trouble fallowing the tutorial. <BR><BR>
I mean, this is just great stuff if you have come this far. And this is one of the hardest tutorials to ever complete.<BR><BR>
If this was too hard for you I think you should buy a book on opening Visual Basic.<BR><BR>
The way I learned to open Visual Basic was by buying the book <b>Sam's Teach yourself how to open Visual Basic in 21 days</b><BR><BR>
But, as you can see I made it shorter than 21 days, my tutorials should only take about... lets see... hmmmmmmmm!!! 14 days!<BR><BR><BR>
